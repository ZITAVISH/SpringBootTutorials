This is a sample eureka server

What is eureka ? 
Eureka is a service discovery which is itself a microservice.

Why do we need it ?
Eureka maintains the registry of each and every microservice which is currently running . Hence eureka helps us in the following ways.
1. To know how many services are up at a specific instant
2. To know which microservies are up at that instance of time.
3. To get the route / url of a specific microservice for inter service data exchange.
